### Linear Regression project covers Ecommerce Customers dataset.
### In the KNN-Project the data was fake, I only tried to use KNN algorithm. To increase precision level I tried to find optimum K value via some loop.
### In the file called randomforestmywork, I used random forest classifier to detect Kyphosis in the Kyphosis dataset. I just try to use random forest for this dataset.
### In the Support-Vector-Machine-Notes there is an information about SVM and little use of SVM
